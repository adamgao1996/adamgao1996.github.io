  abstract     = {Background: Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive method for monitoring blood oxygen saturation that is essential for clinical care. However, existing devices exhibit systematic biases against patients with darker skin tones, leading to healthcare disparities. Objective: We aimed to develop an equity-driven sensing system for measuring skin tone-calibrated peripheral blood oxygen saturation. Methods: We developed OptoBeat, a novel pulse oximetry system that incorporates skin tone measurement and calibration algorithms to provide more accurate oxygen saturation readings across all skin tones. Results: Our evaluation shows improved accuracy and reduced bias across diverse skin tones compared to conventional pulse oximeters. Conclusions: OptoBeat represents a significant step toward more equitable medical sensing technology.},

Traditional soil testing methods are expensive and time-consuming, limiting widespread monitoring.

We develop a novel sensing approach that leverages the electromagnetic properties of lead-contaminated soil and demonstrate its effectiveness across various soil types and contamination levels.},
