<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am Yixuan Gao, a PhD candidate at Cornell Tech. My advisor is [Prof. Rajalakshmi Nandakumar](https://infosci.cornell.edu/~rajalakshmi/), and my PhD committee includes [Prof. Tanzeem Choudhury](https://tech.cornell.edu/people/tanzeem-choudhury/) and [Prof. Deborah Estrin](https://destrin.tech.cornell.edu/). Before coming to Cornell, I conducted undergraduate research under the supervision of [Prof. Tim Brecht](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~brecht/) and [Prof. Ali Abedi](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~abedi/) at the University of Waterloo.

I am passionate about building AI-driven wireless sensing and communication systems to address challenges in health and the environment. I also explore the privacy implications of wireless technologies, with a focus on the ethical conduct of wireless sensing and communication. This includes ongoing collaborative work with [Prof. Helen Nissenbaum](https://nissenbaum.tech.cornell.edu/).

I am also involved in HCI and digital fabrication research, with ongoing collaborations with [Prof. Thijs Roumen](https://www.thijsroumen.eu/). This interdisciplinary work explores the intersection of computational design, interactive systems, and advanced manufacturing techniques.
