# üõ°Ô∏è Acoustic Radar Scanner

**Real-time ultrasonic privacy protection system that detects acoustic tracking attempts**

SensorAlert is an acoustic monitoring system designed to protect your privacy by detecting ultrasonic signals that might be used for acoustic tracking or surveillance. The system analyzes audio in real-time to identify suspicious patterns in the ultrasonic frequency range (18-22 kHz).

The scanner uses Web Audio API to capture microphone input and performs FFT analysis to detect repeated patterns, ultrasonic chirps and sweeps, high-frequency communication signals, and acoustic beacons. It features continuous monitoring, pattern detection algorithms, live spectrogram visualization, and automated threat assessment.
